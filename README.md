# Scripts
My bash scripts. Some of them are good. Others are not. Some useful, some not. 

Scripts I regularly use:
- all jpgs to mp4 // I'm recording a second a day. Sometimes I only have a photo to represent that day. I use this script to turn the photo into a video
- clear vim swap
- min brightness // my dell xps has adaptive brighness that's always kinda bright. I like a dim-ish display. I've mapped this to SUPER+B to turn the brightness *all* the way down.
- clear tex build files // I don't like poluting my folders with tex build files
